G DATA Software AG<br/><br/>Help make G DATA virus protection even better.<br/>
We are constantly striving to improve our virus protection. You can help us do so by participating
in the G DATA Malware Information Initiative.<br/> <br/><b>G DATA Malware Information Initiative
    Data Declaration for Internet Security</b><br/> <br/> <b>What is the G DATA Malware Information
    Initiative?</b><br/> Specialists at the G DATA Security Labs are always trying to find ways to
protect G DATA customers from malware. The more information that is provided about the malware, the
faster and more effectively protection mechanisms can be developed. The G&nbsp;Data Malware
Information Initiative was set up so that such information might be included in its analyses.
Through your participation in this initiative, you can contribute to helping every G&nbsp;Data
customer make smartphones and other mobile devices even safer to use. <br/> <br/> <b>What sort of
    data is collected?</b><br/> On detecting a suspicious or malicious file, the following data is
collected:<br/> -&nbsp;&nbsp;Version of the Malware Information Initiative protocol<br/> -&nbsp;&nbsp;Version
number of the G DATA product and the engines being used<br/> -&nbsp;&nbsp;Version number of the
signatures being used<br/> -&nbsp;&nbsp;Device-specific data concerning the operating system,
language settings (locale) and a GUID<br/> -&nbsp;&nbsp;Information concerning providers available
at the time of the infection<br/> -&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardware-specific information on the device such as
manufacturer, model, device version<br/> -&nbsp;&nbsp;Name and ID of the signature for each malware
file found<br/> -&nbsp;&nbsp;Information concerning the suspicious file: <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;Checksum
for the file or the suspicious parts of it<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;Time of the malware
detection<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;Active provider<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;Market from
which the malware file was downloaded<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;Malware file manifest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;File name and normalised path (%USER% transferred in place of the user's
name)<br/>

<br/> <b>With volume tariffs additional charges may be incurred by the transfer. The volume of data
    is of the order of a few kilobytes and normally gives rise to very small costs.</b><br/> <br/>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> No personal data is transferred. The transferred data is not intended to be used
for and is not suitable for identifying smartphone users.<br/> <br/> <b>How will the received data
    be used?</b><br/> When processing and saving the data we will observe the relevant country's
legal requirements for data protection and forwarding of data. G&nbsp;Data takes great care to
protect data from unauthorised access. <br/> <br/> Evaluation of the data is carried out in the G&nbsp;Data
Security Labs and is used exclusively for clarifying research questions relating to IT security. The
principal intention is to investigate security risks and develop protection mechanisms. Examples of
use include the creation of signatures and block lists, statistical evaluation for publication in
specialist articles, or development and improvement of rule sets for protection technologies. <br/>
<br/> <br/> Participation in this initiative is voluntary and refusal to do so has no negative
effects on the functioning of your G DATA product. Through your participation in the G DATA Malware
Information Initiative, all G DATA customers will in future be better informed about computer-based
threats and the smartphones they use will be even better protected. <br/> <br/> G DATA Software AG,
